README
======

This repository contains the code used for generating the data in the paper "Germline de novo mutation rates on exons versus introns in humans".

This study was conducted after Frigola et al (2017) paper "Reduced mutation rate in exons due to differential mismatch repair".

We employed the code shared by Frigola et al. (2017) as a basis of our own code to ensure comparability of the main analysis.
Therefore, the structure and documentation of this repository highly resembles its structure. However, it has been highly modified and brand-new code has been added as new analysi
es were made. 

We want to thank the Barcelona biomedical genomic lab for sharing the software code, specially to the authors involved in Frigola et al (2017).
Please, check Frigola et al (2017) paper's repository at https://bitbucket.org/bbglab/intron_exon_mutrate for more information.


How to use
----------

The data was generated using a combination of Jupyter notebooks (using Python) and some external libraries and well as some bash, R and Perl scripts.

All notebooks are documented, so you can check which kind of data is needed to run them (and in which folder should it be) and what is the output that is generated. 

Before using
------------

First of all, you need to get our repository:

.. code::

   git clone https://bitbucket.org/weghornlab/germline_intron_exon_mutrate.git

or 

download it from the `downloads page <https://bitbucket.org/weghornlab/germline_intron_exon_mutrate/downloads/>`_.

At the downloads page you will also find ``data.tar.xz`` file with the preprocessed starting data for the **data** folder.

Directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **data** and **non_provided_data** folders contains external data used in our calculations.

In the **data** folder there is a ``README`` file that explains
what data is in each file and how we got it.

The **non_provided_data** folder is the one in which there is mutation data (some not publically available at the time of the manuscript).
On this version now is available for downloading at the downloads section.
See more information in the ``README`` file located in that folder.

The **results** folder is used by the notebooks to write their output there.

The **figures** folder is used by some notebooks 
that generate plots to save the figures in there.

The **other_scripts** folder contains the scripts to generate the coordinates. The results go to **data/coordinates** folder.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To execute the Jupyter notebooks, you need to have Python installed, plus some additional packages.
If you are using conda, you can use the same environment as we used by 
generating the environment from the ``env.yml`` file:

.. code:: bash

   conda env create -f env.yml

Workflow
--------

You should download both ``data.tar.xz`` and ``non_provided_data.tar.xz`` on the corresponding folder. If you do not want to download the ``data.tar.xz``, you can generate the data through several steps:

1. Generate the coordinates with the scripts at **other_scripts** folder. The resulting files should be moved to **data/coordinates** folder. Then execute the **sequences_filtering** notebook.

2. Files at consequence folder can be generated with VEP command line tool.

3. Mappability and nucleosome files can be generated following the instructions at the ``README`` file in **data** folder.

Once you have the **data** and **non_provided_data** folders prepared, there are some orders to execute notebooks:

1. **Direct_signatures** and afterwards **Decomposition_signatures** before any other notebook.

2. **Gene_and_sample_analysis** notebooks, before **Regression_H3K36me3_and_nucleosomes** notebook.

3. **R_plots_preprocess** notebook before making R plots at the **Some_plots.Rmd** script.

4. The rest of the notebooks could be executed afterwards.
